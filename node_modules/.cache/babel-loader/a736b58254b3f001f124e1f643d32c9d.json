Integrate with your platform specific scroll\r\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\r\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\r\n *\r\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\r\n * ===============================\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\r\n * -------------------------------\r\n *\r\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\r\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\r\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\r\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\r\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\r\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\r\n * -------------------------------\r\n *\r\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\r\n *    ... bounce begins ...\r\n *    ... some time elapses ...\r\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\r\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\r\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\r\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\r\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\r\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\r\n *\r\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\r\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\r\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\r\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\r\n *\r\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\r\n * necessary\r\n *\r\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\r\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\r\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\r\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\r\n *\r\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\r\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\r\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\r\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\r\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\r\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\r\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\r\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\r\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\r\n * events.\r\n *\r\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\r\n *\r\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\r\n *\r\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\r\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\r\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\r\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\r\n *\r\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\r\n */\n\nvar emptyObject = {};\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.
